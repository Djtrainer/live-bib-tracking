The Three Key Steps to Go Live
Think of it as a checklist. Swapping the URL is step #3, but it relies on #1 and #2 being done first.

1. Deploy Your Backend to AWS
This is the step that actually creates the live URL. When you deploy your FastAPI application using the Serverless Framework or a similar tool, AWS will create your Lambda function and the API Gateway endpoint that points to it. At the end of the deployment process, you will be given the new, public URL.

2. Configure CORS on Your API Gateway (Crucial!)
This is the most common stumbling block. For security, web browsers prohibit a page from one domain (e.g., your S3-hosted website) from making requests to an API on another domain (your execute-api.amazonaws.com URL) unless the API explicitly allows it.

This permission is granted using CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

You need to configure your FastAPI application to include the necessary CORS headers in its responses. The easiest way to do this is with FastAPI's built-in middleware.

In your server.py file, add the following:

```
# server.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware # Import the middleware

app = FastAPI()

# --- ADD THIS CORS CONFIGURATION BLOCK ---
# List the domains that are allowed to make requests to your API
origins = [
    "http://your-s3-website-bucket.s3-website.us-east-1.amazonaws.com", # Your S3 website URL
    "https://your-custom-domain.com", # If you use a custom domain later
    "http://localhost:5173", # The default Vite dev server for local testing
]

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=origins,
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"], # Allow all methods (GET, POST, etc.)
    allow_headers=["*"], # Allow all headers
)
# --- END OF BLOCK ---


# ... rest of your API endpoints (@app.get, @app.post, etc.) ...
```
3. Change the URL in Your Front-End (Your Step)
Once your backend is deployed and configured with CORS, you can perform the final step of updating the URL in your React code. You will swap out the localhost address for the live API Gateway URL in both your fetch calls and your WebSocket connection string.

So, in short: Yes, it's that easy on the front-end, as long as the backend has been properly deployed and configured to accept the requests.
